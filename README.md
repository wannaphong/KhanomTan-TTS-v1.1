# KhanomTan TTS v1.1

KhanomTan TTS (‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•) is an open-source Thai text-to-speech model that supports multilingual speakers such as Thai, English, and others.

KhanomTan TTS v1.1 is a YourTTS model trained on multilingual languages that supports Thai. We use Thai speech corpora, TSync 1* and TSync 2* [mbarnig/lb-de-fr-en-pt-12800-TTS-CORPUS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mbarnig/lb-de-fr-en-pt-12800-TTS-CORPUS) to train the YourTTS model by using code from the üê∏ Coqui-TTS and remove the voice that have the license's problem (All voice that doesn't use CC-0 or public license) from model, so the model's license is apache-2.0.
